            So you've had it up to here with your job, but don't know what to do

            There must be more to life. Going to work, coming home exhausted. A
            rat on a treadmill. Maybe it wasn't always this way. You might love
            the career but not the job. Or perhaps you want something completely
            different: a brand new path, or maybe start your own business.

            But how to get started, especially with all the pressure. Every.
            Single. Day.

        <div class="ma-2">
            I get it. I've struggled with wondering “should I stay or should I
            go?” I've stayed at some jobs too long, and some not long enough. I've
            kept going back to a career that didn't fully satisfy me. I've dumped
            it all, destroyed my credit, and built it back again. It's painful.

            But it doesn't have to be that way. I put together these tips that I
            wish I had when I was going through this. And here's what's unique:
            they're made <b>specifically for you</b>. Rather than a
            one-size-fits-some approach that you can find all over the web, I
            guide you through questions which are designed
            <i>for your unique nature</i>. This may be the most personal guide
            you've ever received.
